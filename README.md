## Background
Collision detection is the computational problem of detecting an intersection of two or more spatial objects, commonly computer graphics objects. A Collision Simulation simulates the physics of such a collision.
## Notes
Edge Collision is a bit buggy and does not work well with Particle Collision, especially not in gravity. Will fix sometime.
